## Features

- **AI-Powered Responses**: Utilizes state-of-the-art language models to generate human-like answers based on user queries.
  
- **Real-Time Information**: Fetches up-to-date information from the web, ensuring users receive the most current and relevant results.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with a clean and intuitive interface for easy navigation and efficient search experiences.

- **Contextual Understanding**: Analyzes the context of user queries to provide more accurate and relevant search results.

## How It Works

Senna operates by following these steps:

1. **User Query**: The user inputs a query into the search bar.
  
2. **Data Retrieval**: Senna scrapes relevant information from various web pages and databases.

3. **Response Generation**: The system constructs a prompt using the query and fetched data, then calls a language model API to generate a coherent answer.

4. **Display Results**: The generated answer is displayed to the user, along with links to the sources for further reading.
